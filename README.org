A small exercise to test your refactoring skills.

The idea is to take the function in
=/tmp/RefactoringScala/src/main/scala/Refactoring.scala= and give it
some love by refactoring it and making it understandable.

Suggestions are to make use of type synonyms, make the algorithm more
readable, and improve tests first. Then it is really up to your taste
and programming background :)

Have fun!
